# HealthChain



The aim of this framework is twofold: firstly, to integrate blockchain technology into Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems, ensuring secure storage of electronic records; and secondly, to define granular access rules for users within the proposed framework. Additionally, the framework addresses the scalability challenges inherent in blockchain technology through the utilization of off-chain storage solutions for records. Ultimately, this framework offers EHR systems the advantages of a scalable, secure, and integrated blockchain-based solution.
